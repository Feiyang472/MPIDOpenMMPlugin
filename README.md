# About

This plugin implements polarizable multipole electrostatics, primarily aimed at
supporting the [MPID](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4984113) formulation of the
CHARMM Drude force field.  The code supports multipoles up to octopoles, as
well as induced dipoles that may be either isotropic or anisotropic.
